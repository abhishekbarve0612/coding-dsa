## GCD - Greatest Common Divisor OR HCF - Highest Common Factor

### Example:

n1 = 20, n2 = 12

#### Factors of n1

20 = 2 x 2 x 5

#### Factors of n2

12 = 2 x 2 x 3

#### Common Factors: 2 x 2 x 3 x 5 => 4

### GCD => 4

### Basic Euclidean Algorithm for GCD

#### The algorithm is based on the below facts.

    If we subtract a smaller number from a larger (we reduce a larger number), GCD doesnâ€™t change. So if we keep subtracting repeatedly the larger of two, we end up with GCD.
    Now instead of subtraction, if we divide the smaller number, the algorithm stops when we find remainder 0.

### LCM - Lowest Common Multiple

### Example:

n1 = 20, n2 = 12

#### Factors of n1

20 = 2 x 2 x 5

#### Factors of n2

12 = 2 x 2 x 3

#### Unique Factors: 2 x 2 x 3 x 5 => 60

### LCM => 4

# Formula: n1 x n2 = GCD(n1,n2) x LCM(n1, n2)

## One Approach to compute LCM can be using this formula

### First Calculate GCD using above method

#### Divide it with product of given numbers

## Another can be to find all the factors of given numbers

### and get the union of factors of both numbers

#### Their Product will be LCM
